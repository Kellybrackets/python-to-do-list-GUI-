# python-to-do-list-GUI-
Creating my To-Do List App in Python was a practical and rewarding coding project. As someone who values organization and productivity, 
I wanted to design a simple yet effective tool to help users manage their tasks seamlessly.
The app operates through a command-line interface, providing users with an intuitive platform to add, view, and delete tasks. 
Leveraging Python's file handling capabilities, I ensured that task data is stored persistently, allowing users to access their to-do lists across sessions.
To add a touch of interactivity, I implemented features such as marking tasks as complete and prioritizing them. 
The app also displays a clear and concise summary of pending and completed tasks, making it easy for users to track their progress.
Given my penchant for efficiency, I integrated a due date feature. This allows users to set deadlines for tasks, 
providing a helpful visual cue for time-sensitive activities. Python's datetime module came in handy for managing and comparing dates, 
ensuring the due date functionality works seamlessly.
The simplicity of the To-Do List App is intentional, aligning with my belief that productivity tools should be accessible and user-friendly. 
As I continue to refine and enhance this project,
I find joy in knowing that I've created a practical solution that aligns with my personal ethos of staying organized and productive in a straightforward manner.
